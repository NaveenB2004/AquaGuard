# Aqua Guard

**Aqua Guard**, a _smart water tank monitoring system_ was built as a mini-project for the 1st-year 1st-semester subject
module **Fundamentals of Computing** in Sri Lanka Institute for Information Technology (`SLIIT`)'s Information and
Technology degree pathway.

The “Aqua Guard” project aims to develop an innovative water tank monitoring system that leverages IoT technology to
provide real-time data on water levels and consumption patterns, thereby enhancing water management efficiency, reducing
wastage, and promoting sustainable resource usage.
